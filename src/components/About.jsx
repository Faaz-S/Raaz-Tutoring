        `Raaz Tutoring was born from one of those lightbulb moments that changes everything. Picture this: 
        I'm hunched over a math problem with my brother, who's been staring at the same equation for what 
        feels like an eternity. After 30 minutes of back-and-forth, something 
        magical happenedâ€”his face lit up with that "aha!" expression that math teachers live for.`,
        `That moment wasn't just about solving an equation; it was about discovering my purpose. While pursuing 
        Computer Science, I always had a thing for numbers 
        (yes, I was that person who actually enjoyed calculus). But witnessing the transformation from confusion 
        to confidence in my brother's eyes? That was the real variable that changed my equation. And just like 
        that, Raaz Tutoring began its journey.`
